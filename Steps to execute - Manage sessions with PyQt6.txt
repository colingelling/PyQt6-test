1. Going from login to the signed in -page; if the login is successful put the username into a collectable variable THEN get the id from the database and put them into a session variable using QSettings -> WHEN using 'email' instead of username, use it to get the username from the database and include that instead of the email (values collected result: id, username)

2. Check the 'session' -variable on existing credentials and include these within the PyQt windows (if the session variable is empty, revert back to the login window and return a message)

4. Within windows, use the session values in order to get other user related values from the database when needed (SELECT fields FROM users WHERE id = 'session_id')

5. When calling the logout functionality to quit the session, execute remove() on the session variable. Check if it is empty and return back to the login window

- Most important fields for a fundamental base are: id, username and email
- NOTE: Also implement a session check within every window (included non-logged in windows)
