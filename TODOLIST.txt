- Provide user interactions for the register and login view (QLineEdit's) 'Showing when there's something wrong with filled in credentials)

- Add logout functionality (destroy session)

- Improve visual design (reorganizing the css implementation and change style + maybe adding some images)

- Update Readme.md

- Test this project in a clear environment, it seems that when the repository has been cloned and checked out at
development, the application won't start because of database functionality

- Think about Minimal Viable Product
